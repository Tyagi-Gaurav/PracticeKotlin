# PracticeKotlin

- In Kotlin, numbers are objects, and the variable holds a reference to the object, not the object itself
- `==` calls equals method
- `===` checks if the two operands belong to the same object
- `?.` (Safe call) Return null if object is null
- `?:` (Elvis operator). Just like inline if statement
- `!!` Throws NPE if object on which its called is null.
- Generics
  - Invariant
    - When there are no `in` or `out` parameters passed, then it can only accepts references of its own type
  - Covariant
    - If a generic type is covariant, it means you can use a subtype in place of a supertype 
    - Using `<out T>`
    - Ex: Assigning List<Dog> to List<Pet>
    - Cannot be used in function parameters (As its out)
    - Cannot be used as types for var
  - Contravariant
    - Using supertype in place of subtype
    - Using `<in T>`
    - Can be used in function or constructor parameters only.
    - Cannot be used for returning values.
    - Cannot be used as types of val or var property
  - Instead of adding `<in` globally to a class, we can add it locally as well.
    - This could just be as part of function parameter. 
    - In this way when parameter is passed, it can only have supertype passed in for that specific function.
- Lambdas
  - Using TypeAlias
    - A type alias can be used to provide alternate names for an existing type
- Sealed Classes
  - Be able to have enum like classes but be able to add different behavior to those classes.
- Object types
  - When you add an object declaration `(companion object)` to a class, it creates an object that belongs to that class. 
  - One instance of the object is created per class, and itâ€™s shared by all instances of that class.
